wordpress-private-comments
==========================

WordPress plugin that makes it so that comments are only visible to the authorized set (currently administrators).

Users in the authorized set can see comments and create new ones. Unauthorized users (i.e. currently non-administrators) will not see that there are any comments and will be told that comments are closed.
